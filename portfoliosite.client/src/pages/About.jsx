                    Hello! I&apos;m Ben Hawes, a dedicated web developer from Northamptonshire. With a strong foundation in commercial development, I&apos;ve spent the last two years honing my skills at Verto UK. Here, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, gaining hands-on experience with modern web technologies and development practices.

                    <br /><br />Before diving into the world of web development, I gained valuable insights into the QA industry during my time at Universally Speaking. This experience equipped me with a keen eye for detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality, bug-free software.

                    <br /><br />Now, I&apos;m eager to take the next step in my career. I am seeking a dynamic and forward-thinking company where I can continue to grow and further develop my skills. I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly web applications and I&apos;m&apos; always excited to embrace new challenges and learning opportunities.

                    <br /><br />If you&apos;re looking for a dedicated, hardworking, and creative web developer to join your team, I&apos;d love to hear from you.
